Analytics
-Success
-Stories
 (among others) contain  brief overviews of some major Analytics success 
stories.  In this course project, your job is to think carefully about what ana
lytics models and data might 
have been required.
(1)
Browse the short overviews of the projects.  Read a bunch of them –
 they’re really interesting.  
But don’t try to read them all unless you have a lot of spare time; there are lots!
(2)
Pick a project for which you think at least three different Analytics models might have been 
combined to create the solution.  
(3)
Think carefully and critically about what models might be used to create the solution, how they 
would be combined, what specific data might be neede
d to use the models, how it might be 
collected, and how often it might need to be refreshed and the models re-
run.  
DO NOT find a 
description online (or elsewhere) of what the company or organization actually did.
  I want 
this project to be about your idea
s, not about reading what someone else did.
(4)
Write a short report describing your answers to (3).
