## Questions 2.1

_Describe a situation or problem from your job, everyday life, current events, etc., for which a classification model would be appropriate. List some (up to 5) predictors that you might use._

**ANSWER**: Classification is one of the major pillers machine learning stands on. 
From building up AI to classify images to investers classifying investments, 
these methods are everywhere. At my job we were working with an inssurance 
company to classify incidents. The insurance angency want to classify scenarios into different levels of risk, low, medium, and high. 
Features that we were able to use were a ranking of how labor intensive it was to vet the claim, 
the amount paid out in an average case previously, how prevelent or often the claim occured, 
and how many fraudulent cliams have been determined. Although it is impossible to know a total number of fraudlent claims it 
is related to how arduous it is to vet and adds to risk. This can save time and help make the insurance company make pricing choices
